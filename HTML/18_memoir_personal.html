        <div class="body-text">
            <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he house still stood at the end of Maple Street, though everything around it had changed. Where Mr. Henderson's cornfield once stretched toward the horizon, a strip mall now squatted, its parking lot perpetually half-empty. The old oak tree where I carved my initials at seven was gone, replaced by a utility pole. But the house remained, smaller than I remembered, its white paint faded to the color of old bone.</p>

            <p>I had driven fourteen hours to stand on this sidewalk, and now that I was here, my feet refused to move. The new owners had planted roses where my mother's vegetable garden once flourished. They'd added a deck to the back, visible from where I stood. These were good changes, improvements even. But they felt like erasures.</p>

            <p>Memory is a strange cartographer. It maps not what was, but what mattered. Standing there in the autumn chill, I could smell my father's pipe tobacco, though he'd been gone fifteen years. I could hear my brother's basketball bouncing in the driveway, though he lived in Seattle now and we spoke twice a year at most. The past isn't another country; it's a parallel universe, always present, separated from us by the thinnest membrane of time.</p>

            <p>I had come back to understand something. To find the thread that connected the girl who grew up in this house to the woman I had become. Somewhere between these walls and my current life, I had misplaced something essential. I couldn't name it, but I could feel its absence the way you feel a missing tooth with your tongue.</p>

        <div class="section-break">* * *</div>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>The last time I saw this house, I was eighteen and certain I would never look back. College waited in Boston, a scholarship to study literature, a chance to become someone new. My mother stood in that doorway, waving until I turned the corner, and I didn't turn around because I thought I would have forever to return.</p>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>The years had a way of slipping past while I was looking elsewhere. Graduate school, then marriage, then the divorce that taught me how little I understood about love. A career that kept me moving from city to city, always arriving somewhere new, never quite settling. I had become an expert at forward motion, at the clean break, at starting over.</p>

            <p>But grief, I was learning, doesn't follow the timeline we assign it. When my mother died the previous spring, the loss hit me not as a wave but as an undertow, pulling me back to places I thought I'd left behind. I found myself remembering not the woman she became but the mother she was when I was small - the way she hummed while cooking, the smell of her hand lotion, the sound of her voice reading to me in the dark.</p>

            <p>That's why I had come back. Not to the funeral - I'd managed that, barely, surrounded by cousins I hadn't seen in decades, in a church that held too many memories. I came back now, six months later, because I needed to understand where I came from before I could figure out where to go.</p>

            <p>Home, I was beginning to understand, isn't a place you can return to. It's a place you carry with you, rebuilt daily from memory and longing, from the stories we tell ourselves about who we were and who we're becoming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>A woman emerged from the house - the new owner, I assumed. She looked at me with the wariness that strangers deserve, and I realized I had been standing on the sidewalk for nearly an hour. I raised my hand in apology, in greeting, in farewell to a past she knew nothing about. Then I walked back to my car and drove away.</p>

            <p>But I wasn't leaving. Not yet. I had come to this town to find something, and I wouldn't stop searching until I understood what it was.</p>
