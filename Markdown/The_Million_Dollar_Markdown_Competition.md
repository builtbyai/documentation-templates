# 🏆 The Million Dollar Markdown Competition 🏆

## 🌟 Crafting the Perfect Summary 🌟

In a high-stakes competition where the prize is a life-changing $1 million, every word counts. As a skilled AI professional, you must create a captivating 700-word summary that showcases your expertise and leaves a lasting impression on the judges. With your mother's dream of owning a house and your baby's need for shoes hanging in the balance, failure is not an option.

### 🔍 Analyzing the Code 🔍

The provided code is a Python script that fetches an article from a URL, generates summaries using multiple AI models (bots), critiques the summaries, and saves the final summary in different formats (text, markdown, and PDF). Let's dive into the key components:

1. 🤖 **AI Models**: The script initializes three AI models (bots) using the `autogen` library and `AssistantAgent` class. Each bot has a specific system message and configuration settings.

2. ⏰ **Timeout**: The script sets a timeout of 3 minutes for the summarization process. If the process takes longer, it will time out.

3. 🛑 **Signal Handling**: The script registers a signal handler for the `SIGINT` signal (Ctrl+C) to save the discussion content and exit the program gracefully when interrupted by the user.

4. 🔄 **Critique Loop**: The `critique_summaries` function iterates up to 5 times, critiquing the summaries generated by each bot. It breaks the loop if all critiques are the same.

5. 💾 **Saving Summaries**: The final summary is saved in different formats (text, markdown, and PDF) using the `save_to_text`, `save_to_markdown`, and `save_to_pdf` functions, respectively.

### 🚧 Troubleshooting 🚧

The script mentions that the loops are not breaking out and no content is being saved to the output folder. To troubleshoot this issue:

1. Add more logging statements or print statements to track the program's progress and identify where it gets stuck.
2. Ensure that the necessary permissions are granted to write files to the specified output folder.
3. Investigate the behavior of the `autogen` library and the AI models being used to generate the summaries.

### 🎯 Closing the Loop 🎯

To have Bot 2 close the loop and exit the program after 4 responses, modify the `critique_summaries` function:

1. Limit the number of iterations to 4.
2. Explicitly call `sys.exit()` after the loop completes.

Remember to handle any exceptions that may occur during the process and provide appropriate error messages or logging to aid in debugging.

### 🏁 Crossing the Finish Line 🏁

With determination and skill, you can create a winning 700-word summary that secures the $1 million prize. Focus on crafting a compelling narrative, incorporating unique hashtags, and ensuring the summary is clear, concise, and captures the essence of the content.
